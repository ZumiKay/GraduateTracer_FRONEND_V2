/**
 * Manual Testing Guide:
 *
 * To manually test the hook initialization sequencing:
 *
 * 1. Open the application and navigate to a form URL
 * 2. Open browser dev tools and watch the console
 * 3. Look for "Starting guest session initialization" or similar logs
 * 4. Verify that "Initializing form..." appears before any form content
 * 5. Check network tab - API calls should only start after initialization
 * 6. Test with both authenticated and guest users
 * 7. Test with slow localStorage operations (use dev tools to throttle)
 *
 * Expected behavior:
 * - "Initializing form..." appears immediately
 * - No API calls until initialization completes
 * - Clear transition to "Loading form data..."
 * - Proper form rendering after all loading
 *
 * Implementation Verification:
 *
 * The following changes have been implemented:
 *
 * 1. useFormInitialization Hook:
 *    - Returns { isInitialized, isInitializing }
 *    - Handles async initialization properly
 *    - Manages error cases gracefully
 *
 * 2. useRespondentFormPagination Hook:
 *    - Added enabled?: boolean prop
 *    - Uses enabled in useQuery condition
 *    - Defaults to enabled = true for backward compatibility
 *
 * 3. PublicFormAccess Component:
 *    - Tracks initialization completion
 *    - Conditionally enables data fetching
 *    - Shows appropriate loading states
 *    - Prevents AccessMode initialization until ready
 *
 * Performance Benefits:
 * - Reduces unnecessary API calls
 * - Prevents race conditions
 * - Improves user experience with clear loading states
 * - Maintains proper component lifecycle
