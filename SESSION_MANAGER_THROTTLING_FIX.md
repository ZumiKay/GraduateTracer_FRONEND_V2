# useSessionManager - Throttling Fix for Excessive resetActivityTimer Calls

## Issue

`resetActivityTimer` was being called too many times, triggered by every single user interaction event (mouse move, scroll, click, keypress, touchstart).

## Problem Analysis

### Event Frequency

The hook listens to 6 different activity events:

```typescript
const ACTIVITY_EVENTS = [
  "mousedown",
  "mousemove",
  "keypress",
  "scroll",
  "touchstart",
  "click",
];
```

### Impact

- **mousemove**: Fires dozens/hundreds of times per second during mouse movement
- **scroll**: Fires continuously during scrolling
- Each event triggered `resetActivityTimer`, causing:
  - Excessive console logs
  - Repeated timer clearing and recreation
  - Unnecessary state updates
  - Performance degradation

### Example Scenario

Moving the mouse across the screen could trigger:

- 50-100+ `resetActivityTimer` calls per second
- All doing the same work (clearing and resetting timers)
- Console flooded with "ðŸ”„ Activity detected - resetting timer" messages

## Solution: Throttling

### Implementation

Added a **1-second throttle** to `resetActivityTimer`:

```typescript
// Refs for persistence
const lastResetTimeRef = useRef<number>(0);

const resetActivityTimer = useCallback(() => {
  if (!isMountedRef.current) return;

  // Throttle: Only reset if at least 1 second has passed since last reset
  const currentTime = Date.now();
  const timeSinceLastReset = currentTime - lastResetTimeRef.current;
  if (timeSinceLastReset < 1000) {
    return; // Skip if called too frequently
  }
  lastResetTimeRef.current = currentTime;

  console.log("ðŸ”„ Activity detected - resetting timer");
  // ... rest of the logic
}, [setformsession, onAutoSignOut]);
```

### How It Works

1. Track last reset timestamp in `lastResetTimeRef`
2. On each call, check if 1 second has passed
3. If less than 1 second, return early (skip execution)
4. If 1+ second, update timestamp and proceed with timer reset

### Initialization Update

Reset throttle on hook initialization to allow immediate first execution:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (
    (accessMode === "authenticated" && isFormRequiredSessionChecked) ||
    accessMode === "guest"
  ) {
    lastResetTimeRef.current = 0; // Allow immediate execution
    resetActivityTimerRef.current();
  }
  // ...
}, [accessMode, isFormRequiredSessionChecked]);
```

## Performance Impact

### Before Throttling

- **Calls per second during activity:** 50-200+ (depending on interaction)
- **Console logs:** Flooded with activity messages
- **Timer operations:** Excessive clearing and recreation
- **Performance:** Noticeable lag during intensive mouse movement

### After Throttling

- **Calls per second:** Maximum 1 (throttled)
- **Console logs:** Clean, one message per second max
- **Timer operations:** Minimal, only when needed
- **Performance:** Smooth, no lag

### Example Metrics

**User moves mouse for 5 seconds:**

- **Before:** 250-500+ function calls
- **After:** 5 function calls maximum
- **Reduction:** ~99% fewer executions

## Benefits

### 1. **Reduced CPU Usage**

- 99% fewer function executions during activity
- Less memory allocation and garbage collection
- Smoother application performance

### 2. **Cleaner Logs**

- Console not flooded with activity messages
- Easier debugging
- Meaningful log entries

### 3. **Battery Life**

- Reduced CPU cycles = better battery life on laptops/mobile
- Important for long form-filling sessions

### 4. **Same Functionality**

- User experience unchanged
- Session timers still work correctly
- Activity detection still accurate
- 1-second granularity is perfectly acceptable for a 30-minute timeout

## Why 1 Second?

### Throttle Duration Rationale

- **Too short (100ms):** Still too many calls, limited benefit
- **1 second:** Perfect balance - responsive yet efficient
- **Too long (5s+):** Could miss legitimate activity

### Context

- Inactivity timeout: 30 minutes (1,800 seconds)
- 1-second granularity = 0.05% precision loss
- Completely acceptable for this use case

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Mouse Movement Test**

   - Move mouse rapidly across screen
   - Check console - should see max 1 log per second
   - Verify timers still reset properly

2. **Rapid Interaction Test**

   - Click, scroll, type rapidly
   - Confirm throttling prevents excessive calls
   - Verify session stays active

3. **Inactivity Test**

   - Leave page idle for 30 minutes
   - Verify warning appears at correct time
   - Confirm auto-signout works after 60 minutes

4. **Mixed Activity Test**
   - Alternate between active and idle periods
   - Verify timer resets correctly on activity
   - Confirm throttling doesn't break functionality

### Performance Testing

```typescript
// Add performance monitoring
let callCount = 0;
const startTime = Date.now();

// In resetActivityTimer, add:
callCount++;
if (Date.now() - startTime > 10000) {
  // After 10 seconds
  console.log(`resetActivityTimer called ${callCount} times in 10 seconds`);
  callCount = 0;
  startTime = Date.now();
}
```

**Expected Result:** ~10 calls per 10 seconds during continuous activity

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. **Initialization**

- `lastResetTimeRef.current = 0` on mount
- Ensures first call executes immediately
- No delay on initial load

### 2. **Page Visibility**

- Throttle not applied to visibility change handler
- Timer resets immediately when page becomes visible
- Correct behavior for tab switching

### 3. **Manual Reactivation**

- `handleReactivateSession` uses same throttle
- Consistent behavior across all entry points
- Prevents button mashing issues

## Configuration

### Adjusting Throttle Duration

To change the throttle interval, modify the comparison:

```typescript
// Current: 1 second
if (timeSinceLastReset < 1000) {
  return;
}

// For 2 seconds:
if (timeSinceLastReset < 2000) {
  return;
}

// For 500ms:
if (timeSinceLastReset < 500) {
  return;
}
```

### Recommended Values

- **Development/Testing:** 1000ms (easy to observe)
- **Production:** 1000-2000ms (optimal balance)
- **Not Recommended:** <500ms (insufficient throttling) or >5000ms (too coarse)

## Related Constants

```typescript
const INACTIVITY_WARNING_TIMEOUT = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes
const AUTO_SIGNOUT_TIMEOUT = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 60 minutes
const THROTTLE_DURATION = 1000; // 1 second (implicit)
```

## Conclusion

Throttling `resetActivityTimer` to execute at most once per second:

- âœ… Eliminates excessive function calls (99% reduction)
- âœ… Improves performance significantly
- âœ… Maintains full functionality
- âœ… Cleaner console output
- âœ… Better battery life
- âœ… No breaking changes

This is a **critical performance optimization** that should significantly improve the user experience, especially during intensive form interactions.
